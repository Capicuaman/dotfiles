# CAPICUAMAN dotfiles
personal Debian dotfiles, compiled using the bare git repository technique.

* Set a Git repository's work tree to $HOME
* git add and commit your dotfiles to the Git repository. The dotfiles remain at their original paths.
* Push your Git repository to a remote server such as GitHub. Now your dotfiles are backed up, and can be replicated.
